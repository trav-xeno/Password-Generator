# Password-Generator

simple javascript project to create a randomly generated password.
Each password is from 8 to 128 characters in length.
The password will be comprised of alphanuemeric and special chacters.

## Javascript

I choose to learn vuejs at same time for this assignemnt. Overall there are a few functions created.
iscomplete checks if input fields havebeen choosen. If they have been choosen and valid then it returns true and calls checkIfTrue. CheckIfTrue creates a string based on what the user has chosen. This string is then randomly accessed and generates a password.
