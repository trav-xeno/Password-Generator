# Password-Generator

This repo is a javascript project to create a randomly generated password.
Each password is from 8 to 128 characters in length.
The password will be comprised of alphanumeric and special characters based on the user selections.

## Javascript

I choose to learn vuejs at same time for this assignemnt. Overall there are a few functions I created.
iscomplete checks if input fields have been selected. If they have been chosen and valid then it returns true and calls checkIfTrue. CheckIfTrue creates a string based on what the user selection. This string is then randomly accessed and generates a password.
